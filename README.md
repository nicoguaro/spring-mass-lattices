Spring-Mass Lattices
====================

This is a repo for lattices made with springs and lumped masses. These are the simplest components for a periodic material (from a mechanical point of view).

- [Here](https://github.com/nicoguaro/spring-mass-lattices/blob/master/Notes/spring-mass_lattices.pdf?raw=true), there are some notes related with this.
